# Introduction

**JJ65c02** is my own personal interpretation of the noteworthy [Ben Eaters 6502 Computer](https://eater.net/6502) setup. In addition to Ben's work, I've used code, concepts and inspiration from a number of people, all acknowledged below in the **Credits** section. The ultimate inspirations are the venerable Apple II and the Atari 800 personal computers

This project contains 3 main sections:

* The actual JJ65c02 breadboard computer ([Schematics](./Schematics))
* [Software](./Software)
  * The miniOS OS menu and ROM bootloader
  * pico-code : The RP2040/RP2350 A/V chip (VGA driver and PS/2 keyboard interface)
  * x65c02 Emulator
* [Datasheets](./Datasheets)

Each section has its own Readme.md and Folder under this repo.
